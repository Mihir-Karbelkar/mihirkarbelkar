				<h2>Why Puns?</h2>
				<p>Welcome to the punny side of mihirkarbelkar.com! This site was born from my undying love for wordplay and my belief that even the groan-inducing pun has its place in the world of humor.</p>
				
				<p>I've always been fascinated by the way language can be twisted, turned, and transformed to create multiple layers of meaning. Puns represent the perfect intersection of linguistic creativity and humor - they make us think while making us smile (or cringe).</p>
				
				<div class="highlight-box">
					<p class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Did you know?</p>
					<p>The pun is considered one of the oldest forms of humor in human history. Even Shakespeare was a huge fan of wordplay, incorporating over 3,000 puns throughout his works!</p>
				</div>
				
				<h2>The Mission</h2>
				<p>This site has one simple mission: to collect and share puns that are so bad they're good. Whether you're here to:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Find the perfect pun for your next presentation</li>
					<li>Stock up on dad jokes</li>
					<li>Submit your own wordplay creations</li>
					<li>Simply enjoy a good groan</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>...you've come to the right place. Every pun here has been carefully selected for its clever wordplay, its groan-factor, and its ability to make you simultaneously roll your eyes and appreciate the linguistic genius behind it.</p>
